# Open Model Initiative - OMI Model Standards
Welcome to the Open Model Initiative Model Standards repository! 

This project aims to provide community-driven standards and generative media models, with an initial focus on open image generation models. Other modalities may be released in future updates, whether in this repo or others.


## About the Project
The Open Model Initiative Model Standards project is a collaborative effort to create and maintain effective standards for the ecosystem of AI models being developed and trained in the open source community. Our goal is to empower individuals and organizations to leverage and build upon these models for their own solutions, use the models seamlessly across any applications, and to allow creatives the capacity to utilize these emerging tools for their own creative pursuits.

## Key goals:

- Standardized model metadata format for use in the broader model ecosystem
- Comprehensive documentation and tooling for application developers and model trainers to adopt these model standards.

## Contributing
